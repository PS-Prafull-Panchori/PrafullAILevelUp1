One solution to this problem is to intensify communication between the customer and the development team and get feedback as soon as possible. An agile process model that focuses on this is Behavior Driven Development (BDD).
BDD focuses on the behavior of the user and attempts to establish consistency between requirements, implementation, and testing - a common understanding. For this purpose, examples are specified, so-called scenarios, which describe the behavior. This is often done during  "3 Amigos Sessions", in which business, developers, and QA work together.
BDD is quite similar to acceptance test-driven software development (ATDD). In addition, there is a focus on automation: scenarios should serve as executable specifications - they should be automatically testable.
Scenarios are written in a specific language called Gherkin, like this scenario for an online shopping system:
Feature: Discount calculation
Scenario: Discount on Slayer albums for VIP Slayer fans (exclusive contract with BMG)
GIVEN the customers first name is Dominik and his last name is Panzer
AND his birthdate according to our CRM system is 06.06.2006
WHEN the sales clerk lets the system calculate the customers discount on a Slayer album
THEN the discount is 66% \m/
You might already know Gherkin and the GIVEN ... WHEN ... THEN pattern. It's quite similar to ARRANGE... ACT... ASSERT. They are both techniques to give unit tests a clear structure.
